### Hej, I'm Bastian Kirschner! 👋

I work as a full-stack 💻 developer at [pub.](https://pub.tech), build 📱 mobile apps, do 🎨 UI design and co-founded a small 🏡 [media agency](https://nachbarhaus.org).

##### I also helped to develope a few things:

- [🐫 Farewell Arabia](https://makingmarks.uk/farewell-arabia/)
- [📻 BR PULS](http://michaelzahn.de/press/pulsbr)
- [🔊 Playsound](http://michaelzahn.de/press/playsound)
- [🖼 KLANGBILD](http://michaelzahn.de/press/sinnthese)
- [🪴 No Plants, Baby](http://michaelzahn.de/press/noplants)

- ⚡ Fun fact: I found out you can use a fork as a spoon if you use it rapidly enough.
